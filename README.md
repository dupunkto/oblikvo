# Radiotopian

Open-world resource-gathering survival game written using p5js.

## Development

To start the server (with live reloading):

```shell
# If using bix (git.geheimesite.nl/libre0b11/bix)
bix

# Otherwise
npm start
```

To build the project:

```shell
# If using bix
bix build

# Otherwise
npm run build
```

The `dist` folder will contain the bundled, minified JS + sourcemap to put on your server :)
(We have a sourcemap bc I like it if people can read the code)
