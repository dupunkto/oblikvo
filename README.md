# Radiotopian

Open-world resource-gathering survival game written using p5js.

## Development

This project uses [Bake](https://git.dupunkto.org/~robin/dotfiles). To start the server (with live reloading):

```shell
bake serve
```

To build the project:

```shell
bake
```

The `dist` folder will contain the bundled, minified JS + sourcemap to put on your server :)
(We have a sourcemap because I like it if people can read the code)
